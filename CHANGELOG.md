# Changelog

## [v0.5.0](https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/releases/tag/v0.5.0) - 2024-05-29

### New Features

This release is packed with new features. Configs generated by the game are now ingested into the correct mod, and can be edited using our new Text Editor ([#1358](https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1358), [#1346](https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1346)):

The text editor uses [AvaloniaEdit](https://github.com/avaloniaui/avaloniaedit) and comes with syntax highlighting and many features you'd expect a code editor to have. You can even change the theme in the toolbar directly or using our new Settings UI ([#396](https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/issues/396), [#920](https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/issues/920)):

Settings have been in the works for a long time, and we've finally developed a system to easily create settings and allow users to change them. The UI will be expanded with sections, a search bar, and many more features in the future.

Our Downloads Page received a lot of attention in this release as well. It now contains a very nice and sleek download speed chart, and a list of completed downloads ([#1297](https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1297), [#1397](https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1397)):

Clicking the "View in library" button will take you to our new Mods Library. Here you can see a list of all mods you've downloaded and installed. You can also quickly add a mod to your Loadout ([#1268](https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1268), [#1347](https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1347)):

The biggest change we've done is completely overhauling our internal data model and moving *almost* everything to our custom build database called [MnemonicDB](https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.MnemonicDB). The immediate benefit of this change is better faster, the long term benefit is having a reliable database with migrations and opportunities for new and awesome features without being bogged down by our previous data model.

One notable change that the new data model brought to the App is reified deletes.

### Other Changes

## [v0.4.1](https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/releases/tag/v0.4.1) - 2024-04-17

### New Features

The highlight of this PR is the new Apply Diff View ([#1202](https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1202)). You can now preview the changes made to disk before applying the Loadout:

Stardew Valley received three new diagnostics ([#1171](https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1171), [#1168](https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/issues/1168)). These diagnostics use the current game version and a [compatibility matrix](https://github.com/erri120/smapi-versions) to figure out if the currently installed SMAPI version is compatible:

![Screenshot of a critical error where the maximum supported game version of SMAPI is lower than the currently installed game version.](./docs/changelog-assets/15b10289b7aaaefd6f8f9c13da79ced9.webp)

This also includes our first "suggestion" diagnostic. This diagnostic will only appear if you have no mods installed, and it will recommend a supported SMAPI version:

### Other Changes

- A new settings backend was added in preparation for a settings UI. See [#1182](https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/issues/1182) for more details.
- The App will now use two logging files, `nexusmods.app.main.log` and `nexusmods.app.slim.log`, instead of one `nexusmods.app.log` to prevent log collisions between processes ([#1167](https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1167)).
- The default logging level has been changed from `Information` to `Debug` for Release builds to make it easier to debug issues ([#1209](https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1209)).
