## Overview of Mod loading process(es)

Modding Sifu, like most Unreal Engine games is fairly trivial, mods consist of a .pak and a .sig files that need to be installed to "Content\Paks\~mods" (to the root of that directory). The engine loads them automatically.

With Sifu, most mods are simply custom costumes so load order isn't much of a concern.

## Uploaded Files Structure

Some mods contain the files at the root of the archives, others contain the full directory structure Content/Paks/~mods
Some mods may contain multiple pairs of .pak/.sig files but for the most part it should be safe to just move all those files to the right
directory and let the game load them all.
