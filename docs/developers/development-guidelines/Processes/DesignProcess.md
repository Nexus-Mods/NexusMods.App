# Design Process

#### 1. Initial Design Review
- Conduct a high-level, quick review of major limitations that could impact designs.
- Participants: Project Team Lead, Designer, and relevant stakeholders.
- Purpose: Identify and address potential blockers early on.

#### 2. Design Creation
- Start the design process and create Figma designs.
- Track design items in GitHub using a separate Project Board for design.
- Use labels to categorize design items and indicate readiness for development.

#### 3. Technical Design Review
- Review designs with the developers responsible for implementation.
- Ensure technical feasibility and identify potential challenges.

#### 4. Design Approval
- All design items require the Designer's review before implementation.
- Designs do not proceed to development until approved by the Designer.

#### 5. Development Handoff
- Label design items in GitHub to indicate readiness for developers to start work.
- Developers begin implementation based on approved designs.

#### 6. QA and Design Validation
- Upon feature completion, send the implementation to QA.
- QA checks both functionality and design consistency.

#### 7. Handling Multi-Sprint Items
- Ideally, items should not span multiple sprints due to prior refinement.
- Break down tickets into smaller components that align with team structure.

#### 8. Communicating Work in Progress
- Make work-in-progress items visible within the app.
- Use feature flags to control visibility and avoid exposing incomplete features to users.
