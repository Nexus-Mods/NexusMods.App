!!! danger "Important"

    Before playing with the App, you need to know a few things. Please don't skip over this information as it may negatively impact your experience.

    - This is alpha software, meaning it's still very early in development and may have bugs or issues that could break your mod setup. We've done our best to patch up any major problems, but there will always be a few "gotchas" we haven't accounted for. 
    - The app only works on Windows (10+) or Linux. MacOS support is coming later!
    - The current build only supports a [limited number of games](./games/index.md) - more games are planned to be added soon, so don't worry if you don't see your favourites yet!
    - Please only use the app on a clean, un-modded instance of any game installation. This means removing any mods you have installed before managing it with the app. The state of the game folder when you start modding the game will be the state the app will roll back to when mods are removed. 
    - As we release new versions you may be required to reset your loadout and start over. However we'll do our best to avoid this and it won't be a requirement in the final release!
    - The app will work on Steam Deck but the experience isn't optimised yet, let us know how you get on!
