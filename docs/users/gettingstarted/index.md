## Connect your Nexus Mods account

To get the most out of the app, we highly recommend signing in with your Nexus Mods account. If you don't have one yet, you can make one for free [here](https://users.nexusmods.com/register). 

When you first open the app, you will have the option to sign in. If you skipped this step you can always get started by clicking the "Log In" button in the top-right of the application. 

![The top bar navigation of the app while logged out.](../images/0.7.3/Topbar.webp)

On clicking the button, a new page will open in your default web browser where you will be asked to authorise the Nexus Mods app to access your account. 

![The OAuth page requesting the user to grant the app access to their account.](../images/OAuthSignIn.webp)

You will then be prompted to open the app to complete the log in process. Most popular browsers have a "don't ask me again" option to avoid having to accept this message each time the website sends data to the app.
