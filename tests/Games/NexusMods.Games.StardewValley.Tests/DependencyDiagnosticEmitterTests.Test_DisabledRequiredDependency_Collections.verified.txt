[Title] Disabled Dependency
[Summary] 'Farm Type Manager' requires 'Content Patcher' but it is disabled
[Details]
The mod **Farm Type Manager** requires **Content Patcher** to function, but **Content Patcher** is not enabled.


### How to Resolve
1. Enable **Content Patcher** in "Installed Mods"

### Technical Details
The `manifest.json` file included with **Farm Type Manager** lists **Content Patcher** as a requirement in order function. 

The issue can arise in these scenarios:

1. **Disabled Mod**: The required mod is disabled in the loadout
2. **Incorrect Mod ID**: The manifest data for **Farm Type Manager** might be incorrect
