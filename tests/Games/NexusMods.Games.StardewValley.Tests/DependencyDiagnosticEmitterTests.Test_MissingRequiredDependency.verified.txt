[Title] Missing Dependency
[Summary] 'Farm Type Manager' requires 'Content Patcher' which is not installed
[Details]
The mod **Farm Type Manager** requires **Content Patcher** to function, but **Content Patcher** is not installed.


### How to Resolve
1. Download **Content Patcher** from [Nexus Mods](https://nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915?mtm_source=nexusmodsapp&mtm_campaign=diagnostics)
2. Add **Content Patcher** to the loadout. 

### Technical Details
The `manifest.json` file included with **Farm Type Manager** lists a mod with the ID `Pathoschild.ContentPatcher` as a requirement or is using it as a framework in order function. 

The issue can arise in these scenarios:

1. **Missing Installation**: The required mod is not installed
2. **Incorrect Mod ID**: The manifest data for **Farm Type Manager** might be incorrect
