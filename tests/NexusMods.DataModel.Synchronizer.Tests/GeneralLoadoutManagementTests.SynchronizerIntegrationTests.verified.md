## 8 - New Loadout (B) Synced:
After the new loadout has been synchronized, the 'Last Synced State' should match the 'Current State' as the loadout has been applied to the game folder. Note that the contents of this 
loadout are different from the previous loadout due to the new file only being in the previous loadout.
