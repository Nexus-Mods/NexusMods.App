# SMAPI Helper

None of the libraries in [Pathoschild/SMAPI](https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI) except for the `ModBuildConfig` project are uploaded to NuGet. As such, the only way to use the code without much hassle is to include the source code as a submodule and have this wrapper project compile the files.
