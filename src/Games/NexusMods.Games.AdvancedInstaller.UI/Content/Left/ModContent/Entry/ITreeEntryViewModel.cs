    ///     1. Lazy loading of this item should be investigated, in the case that the user has not yet expanded all
    ///        items yet.
    ///
    ///
    ///        When you map a folder, the state of all the children (recursively) must be updated;
    ///        meaning that the items (recursively) need to be loaded. Therefore, opportunities for lazy loading
    ///        are minimal.
    ///
    ///     2. The input collection from which the tree is constructed is immutable.
    ///
    ///        Mods cannot dynamically add files in the middle of the Advanced Installer
    ///        installation process. There is no need to use an observable collection here,
    ///        as that would just be unnecessary memory overhead.
    ///
    ///     Based on the above points, and given that the children count is already known in
    ///     <see cref="FileTreeNode{TPath,TValue}" />; an array is used, as it's the lowest
    ///     overhead collection available for the job.
