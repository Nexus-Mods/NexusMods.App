       Note:
       In the case of folder, the item can be merged or created from multiple sources, e.g. Multiple folders.
       when we unlink the folder/node, the user expects that all of the items under this node are unlinked.

       Therefore, we need to maintain a list of all items we can run an 'unlink' operation on, which can be either
       a file or a directory.
