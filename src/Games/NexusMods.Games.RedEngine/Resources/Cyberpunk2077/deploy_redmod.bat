:: And also handles the breaking change in 1.12.0 (unreleased).script

:: In 1.12.0, protontricks will respect the current working directory,
:: while currently it does not. This is a breaking change. In order
:: to handle both < 1.12.0 and >= 1.12.0, we instead use the STEAM_APP_PATH
:: variable. After that we set the working directory ourselves.
