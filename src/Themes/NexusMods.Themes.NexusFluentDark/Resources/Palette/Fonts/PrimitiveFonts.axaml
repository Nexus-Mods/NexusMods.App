        When you tell Avalonia for look for fonts, it will use the AvaloniaResource resolver to look in the given folder
        specified by the prefix, then look at all the fonts in that folder till it finds one with the given name. This means
        you can't have two fonts with different weights in the same folder. In addition, it seems like Avalonia doesn't support
        variable weight fonts. So...this means you need to pass it a different font for each weight, and put each weight in a
        separate folder. So if you add more weights/fonts, be sure to set them as "AvaloniaResource" in the project file, then
        put them in the correct folder, and link them in as shown below.
