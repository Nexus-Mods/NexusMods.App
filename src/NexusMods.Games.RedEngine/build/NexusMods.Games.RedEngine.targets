     The batch file is only used for running redmod via protontricks (on Linux),
     due to protontricks limitation.
     
     This approach is flawed for cross-compilation scenarios.
     
     Ideally, we would want to copy the file based on the target runtime rather
     than the build machine's OS. This way you can build (not publish) on Linux
     and use on Windows, and vice versa.
     
     However, the properties don't propagate, so when I build `NexusMods.App`, 
     the RedEngine project does not see things like Runtime Identifier (RID).

     I tried for almost 2 hours, but could not find a decent solution that copies
     during build based on the required conditions. Likewise, deleting after
     publish did not work. If you delete after 'Publish' target, as the MSFT gods
     intended, then the file would be re-copied by the build system after that.

     Known limitations:
     - The file won't be included when building for Linux on a non-Linux machine.
     - The file will be included when building for non-Linux platforms on a Linux machine.
