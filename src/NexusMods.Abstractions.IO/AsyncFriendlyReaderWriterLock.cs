/// This is an implementation of a simple <see cref="ReaderWriterLock"/>.
/// It differs from the standard <see cref="ReaderWriterLockSlim"/> in that it allows
/// a different thread than the one that acquired the lock to release it.
///
/// This is useful when needing to run asynchoronous operations that require a lock.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This is used to prevent the concurrent running of the garbage collector
/// and the file store.
/// 
/// When a Garbage Collector is being run, it acquires a write lock (during the process
/// of the whole operation), meaning that no <see cref="IFileStore"/> operations may be done
/// during that time.
///
/// When using the <see cref="IFileStore"/> on the other hand, we acquire a read lock,
/// meaning we can run as many operations as we want concurrently, but cannot run
/// the GC during that time.
