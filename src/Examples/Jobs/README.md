# Jobs Examples

This folder contains examples demonstrating how to use the NexusMods.App Jobs
system for background task management with progress tracking, cancellation
support, and error handling.

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Simple Job Definition

Simple job definitions (using the `Begin` method with a lambda) are used when
you want to handle the execution logic in the same method where you call
`Begin`.

The job definition serves as context/data, while the actual work is done in the
lambda callback right where you need it.

See [**SimpleJobDefinitionExample.cs**](../../../tests/NexusMods.Jobs.Tests/Examples/SimpleJobDefinitionExample.cs).

### Self-Executing Job

A job with entirely self-contained logic/context, to fire and (sometimes)
forget.

The fields you store in the job definition are effectively method parameters
passed in to run the job.

See [**SelfExecutingJobExample.cs**](../../../tests/NexusMods.Jobs.Tests/Examples/SelfExecutingJobExample.cs).

## Best Practices

### Cancellation and Error Handling

Always call `context.YieldAsync()` around expensive, time-consuming code to
support job cancellation.

**For Job Callers:** Use `JobMonitor.Cancel()`, `CancelGroup()`, or
`CancelAll()` to cancel jobs.

**For Job Implementations:** Use `YieldAsync()` to check for cancellation at
natural breakpoints.

**Jobs Cancelling Themselves:** Jobs can cancel themselves using
`context.CancelAndThrow()` when conditions require termination.

**Interactive Cancellation:** Jobs may interact with external components (like
UI dialogs) that can cancel. Propagate external `OperationCanceledException`
through `context.CancelAndThrow()`.

See [**CancellationExample.cs**](../../../tests/NexusMods.Jobs.Tests/Examples/BestPractices/CancellationExample.cs) and
[**InteractiveCancellationExample.cs**](../../../tests/NexusMods.Jobs.Tests/Examples/BestPractices/InteractiveCancellationExample.cs).

### Progress Reporting

Use percentage for determinate progress when total work is known. For
indeterminate progress, use `Size.One` as maximum to avoid division by zero.

See [**DeterminateProgressExample.cs**](../../../tests/NexusMods.Jobs.Tests/Examples/BestPractices/DeterminateProgressExample.cs)
and [**IndeterminateProgressExample.cs**](../../../tests/NexusMods.Jobs.Tests/Examples/BestPractices/IndeterminateProgressExample.cs).

### Factory Methods

Often you want to fire a job right away after it is created. In this case,
make `Create()` helper functions to encapsulate the job creation and job
starting logic as one.

Factory methods encapsulate dependency injection and job configuration,
creating reusable job creation patterns.

See [**FactoryMethodExample.cs**](../../../tests/NexusMods.Jobs.Tests/Examples/BestPractices/FactoryMethodExample.cs).

## General Guidelines

- Use `record` types for job definitions as they should not mutate parameters
- Handle resource cleanup within job execution logic before completion
- Follow existing codebase patterns

## Caveats

!!! warning "Job Disposal Not Implemented"

    While jobs can implement `IDisposable` or `IAsyncDisposable`, they're not
    actually disposed by the job system. If you need resource cleanup, handle
    it within the job's execution logic before completion.

## Common Patterns

- Use `record` types for job definitions as they should not mutate their
  parameters
- Call `context.YieldAsync()` around expensive operations to support
  cancellation
- Use `SetPercent()` with `Size.From()` for progress reporting
- Access job data through `context.Definition`
