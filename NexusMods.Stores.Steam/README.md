## NexusMods.Stores.Steam

A minimalist API wrapper for accessing steam files via a Steam Login. For now this is used only 
to collect and process hash data about games and their files. If this code ends up working
well enough we may integrate it with the larger app, but for now this is only for supporting
utilities.
